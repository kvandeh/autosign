# AutoSign
Automatically adds a date and name on top of every file which is automatically converted to a comment when edited.
The extension uses the default comment logic and has a lot of features, including:
- MIT or Apache 2.0 license or a custom one,
- Saves after custom timeout or when switching files,
- Put a custom email.

I created this extension as I didn't like the behavior of others, to compare:
- AutoSign will only put a small notice at the top of last edit and not a full copyright notice in each file,
- Supports every language as AutoSign uses the built in VSCode comment line logic,
- Adds a custom or preset license with your details.
